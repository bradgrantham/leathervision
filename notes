TODO
move vdp_int and coinc bits to VDP status byte, test them there, return that byte and clear on read
implement fifth sprite check & status register content
make IO read/write decoding match schematic

No known issues or very minor issues but need to verify against Youtube or real thing or another simulator

    none

Known serious issues preventing game play
    Jungle Hunt
        incorrect rendering of vines
        aborts with interrupted VDP command
    Frogger - aborts with unknown IO

        strange high-pitched whistle when there seems like there should be a rest between notes during play

        a little chirping during soundtrack - am I not doing silencing correctly?
    Super Cross Force
        there's no animation during explosion - is that normal?
    Beamrider
        stars show up after dying - is that normal?
    Defender
    Dig Dug

Maybe 2 or 3 bugs:
    * controller read issues, e.g. Defender, Dig Dug, Slither
    * rendering at least one video mode incorrectly, e.g. Jungle Hunt, Pitfall
    * some kind of failure to read interrupt, e.g. Frogger

need to line up VDP interrupt and scanout more correctly - I think this is what's causing corruption in Jungle Hunt swimming - do scanout to texture every 16.67ms of simulation time

make different scanout code for different modes & then sprite code
