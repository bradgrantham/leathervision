        strange high-pitched whistle when there seems like there should be a rest between notes during play
    Pitfall II - Lost Caverns
        a little chirping during soundtrack - am I not doing silencing correctly?
    Super Cross Force
        there's no animation during explosion - is that normal?
    Beamrider
        stars show up after dying - is that normal?

Works with minor issues
    Jungle Hunt
        incorrect rendering of vines
        lots of garbage on swimming screen - wrong 8x8s fetched, wrong sprites?
    Pitfall!
        couple corrupted sprites on screens 2 and later - sprites not being cleared?

Known serious issues preventing game play
    Frogger - hangs at initial screen with one note playing continuously - doesn't detect VBLANK / VDP?
    Defender - hangs at "press N for N player game"; reading controller differently?
    Slither - no controls; reading the controller differently?  Controller 2?
    Dig Dug - never detects game selection; reading controller differently?
    Miner 2049er - seg fault

Maybe 2 or 3 bugs:
    * controller read issues, e.g. Defender, Dig Dug, Slither
    * rendering at least one video mode incorrectly, e.g. Jungle Hunt, Pitfall
    * some kind of failure to read interrupt, e.g. Frogger

need to line up VDP interrupt and scanout more correctly - I think this is what's causing corruption in Jungle Hunt swimming - do scanout to texture every 16.67ms of simulation time

make different scanout code for different modes & then sprite code
